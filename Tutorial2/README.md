Tutorial 2 - VGA buffer and ROM download

In this tutorial we implement a IP double port on chip ram to the video controller. We also download a ROM file into this ram.

The Generated RAW image ROM file should be put in your MiSTers
/media/fat/games/GERANIUM/ directory for ease of use. Pushing F12 brings up the menu from which you can load the ROM from.
