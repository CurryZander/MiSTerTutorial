Geranium MiSTer Tutorial Project
By SKuRGe911(Troy Marchant)

This is an FPGA tutorial that will help you learn system verilog. I designed it because I found a lack of learning material for the MiSTer system. I am no expert in FPGA programming, but i hope this simple tutorial will help others and get you up to speed on FPGA programming more quickly than it did me.

The software required to build the projects is quartus prime. I think the free edition can not create the .rbf output files. So you might want to consider buying the standard edition. I use version 17.1 in this tutorial projects. Later we will also use the modelsim software to simulate designs. I think the free edition of that should suffice.

Enjoy.
