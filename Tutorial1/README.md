Geranium MiSTer Tutorial Project
By SKuRGe911(Troy Marchant)

Tutorial 1 - VGA controller

In this tutorial we will get the basics of a VGA component running. The files here are the basics of a MiSTer system and are used as a starting point for the tutorials.

The SYS directory contains the MiSTer system files used by most projects on the MiSTer.

In the SYSTEM directory I put the main system verilog file and in the VIDEO directory is the video modules .sv file. The source of the files is defined in the .qip files, so dont add source files to the project in the GUI but add them to these .qip files.

The timing I use for the VGA component is from the site http://tinyvga.com/vga-timing/640x480@60Hz
